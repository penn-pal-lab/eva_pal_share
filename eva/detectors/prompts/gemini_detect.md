Perform object detection on this image for the task: "{task_instruction}"

RULES:
1. Detect only COMPLETE, physically distinct objects. Never detect parts of an object.
   - WRONG: "pineapple_body", "pineapple_leaf", "cup_handle"
   - RIGHT: "pineapple_toy", "cup"
   - WRONG: "B b
2. Limit to 10 objects maximum. Prioritise objects mentioned or implied by the task first,
   then other objects on the table a robot might interact with.
3. Task-relevant objects first: identify and label the objects the task refers to before
   anything else, using colors/descriptors from the instruction where applicable.
   (e.g. if task says "pick up the red apple", your first bbox should be the red apple)
4. If the same object appears multiple times, label them object_1, object_2, etc.
   If objects are nested (e.g. cup inside bowl), detect each whole object separately —
   do NOT split either into parts.
5. DO NOT include: robot, robot gripper, table surface, walls, floor, people,
   or objects too far away to be relevant.
6. Coordinates: normalized 0–1000 as integers, format [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax].

Return a single JSON object (no code fencing, no extra text, start with {{ end with }}):
{{
    "bboxes": [
        {{"box_2d": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax], "label": "object name"}},
        ...
    ]
}}

Only include objects you actually see in the image.
